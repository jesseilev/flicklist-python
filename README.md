A webapp for educational Purposes. Broken into a series of steps designed to be [taught during successive class periods](https://education.launchcode.org/web-fundamentals/studios/) as part of LaunchCode's [Web Fundamentals](https://education.launchcode.org/web-fundamentals/about/) unit.

Note. This original version has since been [migrated to Flask](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist-flask).
